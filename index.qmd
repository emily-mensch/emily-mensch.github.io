**Welcome!**

I'm a PhD student in the Ecology Graduate Group at the University of California, Davis. I work with the [Karp Lab](https://karp.ucdavis.edu/), focusing on harmonizing conservation and agriculture and the [Rypel Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/rypel-lab/home), focusing on fisheries, aquatic ecology, and conservation science. I am a fish ecologist and conservation biologist with applied research interests: using ecological theory and field research to help solve real-world problems. I hold degrees in Fisheries and Wildlife from Michigan State University (MS), and Ecology and Conservation Biology from Colorado State University (BS). Learn more by reading about my [research](projects.html) or checking out my [CV](CV.html)!
