I work with the Karp Lab, focusing on harmonizing conservation and agriculture, and the Rypel Lab, focusing on fisheries, aquatic ecology, and conservation science. I am a fish ecologist and conservation biologist by trade, and my research goals are applied: using ecological theory and field research to help solve real-world problems. I hold degrees in Fisheries and Wildlife from Michigan State University (MS), and Ecology and Conservation Biology from Colorado State University (BS).
