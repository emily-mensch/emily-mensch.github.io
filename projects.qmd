### Harnessing a "fear" odor for invasive fish management:

The landscape of information in aquatic environments stinks – that is, aquatic organisms rely extensively on olfactory information to survive and reproduce. One such organism, the sea lamprey *(Petromyzon marinus)*, depends on a variety of odors to guide its movement decisions during its upstream spawning migration. Among this is an alarm cue, a chemical mixture released from injuries that guides migrants around areas where predators are active. This cue elicits a marked anti-predator response in individuals exposed to injured or dead lamprey. The sea lamprey is a historically destructive invasive species in the Laurentian Great Lakes, leading to significant ecological and economic damage if left unchecked. Management efforts including dams and lamprey-specific pesticides have been largely successful but adding tools to the management toolbox is necessary due to societal pressures to reduce pesticide use and remove dams, and uncertainties regarding lamprey resistance to pesticides and frequency of dam failures. Harnessing the lamprey’s innate behavioral response to this ‘fear’ odor could be a fruitful supplementary control method by manipulating movement decisions to benefit management during the fish’s migration. The chemistry of alarm cues has proven elusive. We used behaviorally guided fractionation in controlled laboratory raceways to test behavioral reactivity to compounds believed to be a part of this cue. The knowledge gained in the study pushed us further to understanding the chemical constituents that make up the sea lamprey alarm cue mixture and will inform future studies aiming to understand the makeup of the cue. Once the chemistry is known, managers will be provided with a supplementary control technique for dually managing invasive species and species of conservation concern, and science will be provided with the first full description of a fish alarm cue mixture, aiding in the understanding of how organisms use olfaction in predator-prey dynamics.
