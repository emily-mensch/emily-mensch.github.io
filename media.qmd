### Relevant student run publications! 
I currently act as an editor/content creator for UC Davis's ecology graduate student run magazine, the Aggie Brickyard, and formerly was an editor/designer/writer for Michigan State University's fisheries and wildlife graduate student run magazine, Spotlight. I **love** student led publications, and think they are a wonderful way to get a taste of a breadth of research, sure, but they also help place you in the heart of graduate student communities. Graduate students are passionate, smart, caring, and creative - and their words, thoughts, poems, pictures (aka everything you can't get from their dry-by-necessity publications) deserve to be SEEN ! See them here, and **please** show me your student-led publications!
